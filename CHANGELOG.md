# Changelog

## 0.5.0 — script rendering

- Integrate offline reliability fixes while preserving the independently updated GIF demo.
- Add a validated versioned script format with imported and generated shots, an offline
  dry-run default, explicit execution, and a per-run request cap including transient retries.
- Persist attempts before sending; reuse checksum-verified shots and support explicit
  single-shot regeneration without replacing other approved shots.
- Add first/last frames, contact sheet, review-required continuity diagnostics, captions,
  a render manifest and a receipt. Verify the staged H.264 film with ffprobe and full decoding.
- Include a three-shot offline example and a separate unrendered character-continuity proposal.
- Visual identity and seamless motion remain human acceptance criteria, not automated guarantees.
